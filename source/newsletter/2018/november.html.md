Wir freuen uns sehr, diesen Monat zum OpenStack Summit Berlin in Deutschland zu sein! So aufgeregt, dass wir auf Deutsch sprechen! Aber nicht immer! 

Back to English!

As we said, we’re attending OpenStack Summit Berlin this month, celebrating all the OpenStack things, and ready to embrace the future of the RDO Community.

### Volunteers Needed for the RDO Booth at OpenStack Summit Berlin
We are gearing up for [OpenStack Summit Berlin](https://www.openstack.org/summit/berlin-2018/) where we'll have our regular presence within the Red Hat booth. This fall we'll continue the ManageIQ / RDO demo we started last year and we'd love to see your demos, too! If you've got something you'd like to demo via video OR LIVE because you're not afraid of ANYTHING, [sign up](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/rdo-vancouver-summit-booth).

We're also looking for people to spend their precious free time [answering questions](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/berlin-summit-community-pod) at the RDO booth. If you're attending, please consider spending one or more of your free moments with us. Questions run the gamut from "What's RDO?" to "I found a bug in Neutron and need help troubleshooting it." Of course, you're not expected to know everything and you can always keep IRC open to access the RDO Community for help! Plus, you get cool stuff! If you show up for three or more shifts, we're going to hook you up with an RDO hoodie.

Reach out to Rain Leander on IRC (leanderthal) or email (rain@redhat.com) for more information.

### The Future of the RDO Community
Just in case you might have any further questions regarding [IBM’s acquisition of Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/ibm-acquire-red-hat-completely-changing-cloud-landscape-and-becoming-worlds-1-hybrid-cloud-provider), especially with regards to the RDO Community, Brian Proffitt published an article to focus on how [some are wondering what this acquisition will mean for the many upstream projects in which Red Hat participates and sponsors](https://community.redhat.com/blog/2018/11/for-communities-ibm-red-hat-means-stronger-commitment/).

### Community Meetings
Every Wednesday at 15:00 UTC, we have the weekly RDO community meeting on the #RDO channel on Freenode IRC. The agenda for this meeting is posted each week in a [public etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/RDO-Meeting) and the minutes from the meeting are posted [on the RDO website](https://www.rdoproject.org/community/community-meeting/). If there's something you'd like to see happen in RDO - a package that is missing, a tool that you'd like to see included, or a change in how things are governed - this is the best time and place to help make that happen.

Every Thursday at 15:00 UTC, there is a weekly **CentOS Cloud SIG meeting** on the #centos-devel channel on Freenode IRC. The agenda for this meeting is posted each week in a [public etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/centos-cloud-sig) and the minutes from the meeting are posted [on the RDO website](https://www.rdoproject.org/contribute/cloud-sig-meeting/). This meeting makes sense for people that are involved in packaging OpenStack for CentOS and for people that are packaging OTHER cloud infra thingies (OpenNebula, CloudStack, Euca, etc) for CentOS. “Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.” - Helen Keller

### Bringing The Community Together
Jeremy Stanley recently [announced over SEVERAL mailling lists](http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2018-September/134911.html) that “...the openstack, openstack-dev, openstack-sigs and openstack-operators mailing lists (to which this is being sent) will be replaced by a new openstack-discuss at lists.openstack.org mailing list. The new list is [open for subscriptions now](http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack-discuss), but is not yet accepting posts until Monday November 19 and it's strongly recommended to subscribe before that date so as not to miss any messages posted there. The old lists will be configured to no longer accept posts starting on Monday December 3, but in the interim posts to the old lists will also get copied to the new list so it's safe to unsubscribe from them any time after the 19th and not miss any messages.”

### Join CloudKitty On The First Friday Of Each Month At 15h00 UTC
[CloudKitty](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/CloudKitty) is the project name of a Rating-as-a-Service project. Meetings will happen in the #cloudkitty channel on Freenode. They should (for now) be held on the [first Friday of each month at 15h00 UTC](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/cloudkitty-meeting-topics). Of course, the time / frequency can be adapted to what suits the community the best. These meetings were a thing in the project's early days and have slowly stopped, which we really regret.

This is part of a larger effort to get more in touch with the community. We would gladly welcome new contributors and ANY contribution of ANY kind - bug report, review, documentation
suggestion/update, commit - is welcome.

If you haven’t already, please [add yours to the list](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/OSSummit-RDOtalks). We’ll be promoting these talks via social media prior to as well as during the conference.

### Call For Papers
There are a handful of relevant conferences with open CFPs. Need help figuring out a good topic or finalizing your abstract? Feel free to reach out in the #RDO channel on IRC.

* **Red Hat Summit Boston Massachusetts USA 07-09 May 2019** Share your ideas with thousands of open source enthusiasts by submitting a session for [Red Hat Summit 2019](https://www.redhat.com/en/summit/2019). There's a lot going on in open source, and we need your help to talk about it. Please submit an abstract based on one of the topics we will feature this year. [CFP closes 19 November 2018 23:59 UTC](https://rhsummit2019.eventpoint.com/)

* **ServerlessDays Amsterdam The Netherlands 29 March 2019** [ServerlessDays](https://serverlessdays.nl/) started life as JeffConf, a tongue in cheek conference in the spirit of Paul Johnston’s blog post, “Serverless is just a name. We could have called it Jeff”, an attempt to move beyond the Serverless buzzword and focus on the practical use of function as a service platforms and the value they provide. It is a one day, community focused, single track event centred on real world Serverless based solutions. It’s about fostering a community and helping all of us learn from each other as we embrace a new way of building applications. [CFP closes at November 26, 2018 23:11 UTC](https://www.papercall.io/serverless-ams-2019)

* **Open Source Data Center Conference Berlin Germany 14-15 May 2019** Innovative strategies, forward-looking developments and new perspectives in dealing with complex data centers are welcome topics of [OSDC](https://osdc.de/).
